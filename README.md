# LegendOfZeldaVerticalSlice
This was a project that i worked on with two other deveploers, my role was gameplay and ai programming. 

In this project i achived the following:
-- Programmed the character controller for link (Movmement, combat, and interacting with objects in the level)
-- Rigged and set up all animations in project
-- Programmed the enemy ai
-- helped programmed some of the inventory and scence transitions

Being apart of this project really opened my eyes to the work flow of develeping a game with a team, it also improved my undersatnding of version controll and project management,
I now have a better ability and perspective of setting realistic due dates on new features
